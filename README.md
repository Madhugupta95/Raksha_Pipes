# 🛠️ Raksha Pipes Data Management and Visualization System

## 📋 Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the Raksha Pipes assignment, which involves building a data management and visualization system from scratch. The system includes generating data, designing a MySQL database, setting up the database, and creating a dashboard in Power BI.

## 📁 Folder Structure
- **data_generation**: Contains Python scripts for generating fake data for the Raksha Pipes database.
- **database_design**: Includes the schema design for the MySQL database.
- **sql_scripts**: Holds SQL scripts for creating tables and inserting data into the MySQL database.
- **power_bi_dashboard**: Contains the Power BI file for the interactive dashboard.

## 📝 Instructions
### Step 1: Generate Data and Design Database
#### Data Generation
- Run the Python scripts in the `data_generation` folder to generate fake data for the Raksha Pipes database.
- Ensure that the data includes product types, customer details, and sales information.

#### Database Design
- Refer to the schema design document in the `database_design` folder for the MySQL database schema.
- Aim for a minimum of 8 different but related tables in the database.
- Ensure correct table connections and avoid redundant data.

### Step 2: Set Up Database in MySQL
#### Database Creation
- Execute the SQL scripts in the `sql_scripts` folder to create the database tables in MySQL.

#### Data Population
- Run the SQL scripts to insert the generated data into the respective tables.

### Step 3: Create Dashboard in Power BI
#### Connect Database
- Open Power BI and connect to the MySQL database created in Step 2.

#### Build Dashboard
- Use the Power BI file in the `power_bi_dashboard` folder to create an interactive dashboard.
- Include visualizations for sales trends, product performance, and customer profiles.
- Ensure ease of use and allow users to explore the data.

## 📊 Presentation
- The final work should be documented in a report, detailing the process of data generation, database design, database setup, and dashboard creation.
- Additionally, create a video presentation demonstrating the system's functionality and key features.
